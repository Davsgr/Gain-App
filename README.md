## Why Gain App ? 
I receive every week a .doc file with the different exercises and break to do. 
To respect correctly the break and the series I was always on my watch or my mobile phone to see the timing. Of course not a good solution. 

That's why I try to do something more easier to respect all the informations from my coach :)
